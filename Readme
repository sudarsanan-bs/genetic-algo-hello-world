One of the reasons for loss of life during shipwrecks is that there are not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. 
Although there is some element of luck involved in surviving a sinking ship, some groups of people were found more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This is a hypothetical analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, this is an attempt to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
